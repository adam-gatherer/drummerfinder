### A Python script to scrape ads
I wrote this whilst looking for a drummer from my band. Decided to make it scrape all ads to filter through them instead of just looking for drummers. With a list of ads you can e-mail yourself once a week to save time searching. Currently, it scrapes the first two pages of ads posted in all regions of the UK and formats them with the ad title, location, date, and a hyperlink to the ad. This list can then be used later.

At time of writing, no drummer has been found. The search continues.
